=== Standard Ruby project

  guard 'test' do
    watch('^lib/(.*)\.rb')        { |m| "test/lib/#{m[1]}_test.rb" }
    watch('^test/(.*)_test.rb')   
    watch('^test/test_helper.rb') { "test" }
  end

=== Ruby On Rails project

  guard 'test' do
    watch('^app/models/(.*)\.rb')                       { |m| "test/unit/#{m[1]}_test.rb" }
    watch('^app/controllers/(.*)\.rb')                  { |m| "test/functional/#{m[1]}_test.rb" }
    watch('^app/controllers/application_controller.rb') { "test/functional" }
    watch('^app/controllers/application_controller.rb') { "test/integration" }
    watch('^app/views/(.*)\.rb')                        { "test/integration" }
    watch('^lib/(.*)\.rb')                              { |m| "test/lib/#{m[1]}_test.rb" }
    watch('^test/(.*)_test.rb')
    watch('^test/factories.rb')                         { "test/unit" }
    watch('^test/test_helper.rb')                       { "test" }
  end

== Options

Guard::Test allows you to choose between two different runners (Guard::Test's runners are inherited from Test::Unit's console runner):
- <tt>'default'</tt>: Display tests results as they happen, with different chars ('.' for pass, 'F' for fail, 'E' for error) and print failures/errors messages & backtraces when all the tests are finished. Obviously, this is the guard-test default.
- <tt>'fastfail'</tt>: Display tests results as they happen and print failures/errors messages & backtraces immediately.

Set the desired runner by passing the <tt>:runner</tt> option to the <tt>guard</tt> method:

  guard 'test', :runner => 'fastfail' do
    ...
  end
