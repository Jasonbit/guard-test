== Guardfile

Guard::Test can be adapted to many kind of projects.

=== Standard Ruby project

  guard 'test' do
    watch(%r{lib/(.*)\.rb})      { |m| "test/#{m[1]}_test.rb" }
    watch(%r{test/.*_test\.rb})
    watch('test/test_helper.rb') { "test" }
  end

=== Ruby On Rails project

  guard 'test' do
    watch(%r{app/models/(.*)\.rb})                     { |m| "test/unit/#{m[1]}_test.rb" }
    watch(%r{app/controllers/(.*)\.rb})                { |m| "test/functional/#{m[1]}_test.rb" }
    watch(%r{app/views/.*\.rb})                        { "test/integration" }
    watch(%r{lib/(.*)\.rb})                            { |m| "test/#{m[1]}_test.rb" }
    watch(%r{test/.*_test.rb})
    watch('app/controllers/application_controller.rb') { ["test/functional", "test/integration"] }
    watch('test/test_helper.rb')                       { "test" }
  end

Please read {Guard doc}[https://github.com/guard/guard#readme] for more info about Guardfile DSL.

== Options

Guard::Test allows you to choose between two different runners (Guard::Test's runners are inherited from Test::Unit's console runner):
- <tt>'default'</tt>: Display tests results as they happen, with different chars ('.' for pass, 'F' for fail, 'E' for error) and print failures/errors messages & backtraces when all the tests are finished. Obviously, this is the guard-test default.
- <tt>'fastfail'</tt>: Display tests results as they happen and print failures/errors messages & backtraces immediately.

Available options:

    :runner => 'fastfail'      # default to 'default'
    :bundler => false          # don't use "bundle exec"
    :rvm => ['1.8.7', '1.9.2'] # directly run your specs on multiple ruby

Set the desired options as follow method:

  guard 'test', :runner => 'fastfail', :bundle => false, :rvm => ['1.8.7', 'ree'] do
    ...
  end
